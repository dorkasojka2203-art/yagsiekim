		<p style="font-size: 24;">The Tsaritsa (Russian: Царица Tsaritsa), her Goetic name and corresponding ideal yet unknown, <br>is the current Cryo Archon among The Seven who presides over Snezhnaya. <br>With supreme rule over Snezhnaya, she uses her loyal followers in the Fatui to manipulate and intimidate the other nations of Teyvat.<br>She is targeting the other Archons' Gnoses for reasons unknown, though it likely relates to her goal of "burning away the old world."<br>The Tsaritsa also has the ability to grant her subjects a power separate from Visions, called Delusions.<br>These Delusions are used by high-ranking Fatui such as Fatui Agents, <br>Fatui Cicin Mages, Mirror Maidens, Fatui Operatives, Fatui Oprichniki, and the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.</p>
